The Lyric Generation file is our implementation of the TensorFlow RNN tutorial.
The data parsing file is how we converted the two data files into .txt files for the RNN model.
Coldplay.csv contains the Coldplay lyrics data, while raw_data.json contains the Mac Miller data. The Shakespeare data is downloaded in the Lyric Generation notebook
